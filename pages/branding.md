# Branding

## What colours should I use?

We have two brand colours. These should be used sparingly and not be used in very large blocks of colours.

### Brand Colours
Primary #1591fe - Icons, highlight

Secondary #18304b - Main headings, navigation, icons

### Grey tones
For consistency, we try to use these greyscale values throughout our interfaces.

Body #010101 - body content

Disclaimers #777 - disclaimers

Box 1 - #e5e5e5 - boxes

Box 2 - #f5f5f5 - boxes

### Call to Action

Green #27ae60 - Primary call to action buttons

Orange #f17935 - Text links, hover state and  more info buttons


### Blue tones

Light blue e6f3ff - Backgrounds when more prominence is needed vs a grey background

Mid blue #d0e9ff - Dividing lines on light blue background, froms and tooltips 

Dark blue #0076cc Links and comparison tables

### System
These are not part of our brand, but we use these in special cases.

Red #dd4b39 - Error messages
Yellow #dd4b39 - Warning messages


## What fonts should I use?

We use [Proxima Nova](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova) for all of our text and headings.
