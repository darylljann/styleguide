# finder.com.au front-end styleguide

This document contains guidelines for web pages built by finder.com.au and developers who work with us.

The primary purpose of these documents is to ensure code consistency and best practice. This helps ensure our code base looks like it's written by one developer, and allows us to pass code between developers with ease. By adhering to best practices, we ensure optimized page loading, performance and maintainable code.
